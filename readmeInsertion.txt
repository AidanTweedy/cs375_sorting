Insertion Sort readMe

To compile and run:
Update make file so every instance of quicksort is InsertionSort. 
In the terminal, run "make", then "run"

Data Structures:
The only data stucture used was arrays. Arrays we're used to store the elements of the array to be sorted.

Time complexity:
The best time conplexity is O(n), very good compared to other sorting algo
The worst and average time complexity is O(n^2), very bad compared to other sorting algo
